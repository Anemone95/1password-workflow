## About

This Workflow is for 1Password 8. For older versions, see Alfred Preferences → Features → 1Password.

Before the first use, [install the 1Password CLI](https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/) and turn on “Biometric Unlock for 1Password CLI” under the Developer tab of the 1Password preferences. Do this even if your Mac does not support Touch ID.
